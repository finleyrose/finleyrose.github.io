Our range of second hand order pickers make for faster, more accurate order picking. You'll also want to make sure your truck can handle the added weight of larger tires, especially if you aren't specifically doing anything to the suspension itself.</p>

The W-series also includes five other versatile pallet trucks with a load capacity up to 2.5 tonnes, making them suitable for all manner of material handling, including horizontal transportation and order picking.</p>

Our Forklift Service department and Forklift Parts department is proud to offer service and parts for all major forklift brands. The larger tires allowed by lifted trucks is one of the biggest advantages for going off-road with this type of vehicle.</p>
<p>You can already see that lifted trucks have some real advantages when it comes to going off-road, thanks to the greater clearance they enjoy. Operators should be trained to operate the type of trucks they work on. They should also know the potential risks for each model.
