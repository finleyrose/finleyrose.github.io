Pallet jack - A forked vehicle for manual movement of a single pallet, similar to Class III trucks above, but with no power source for lifting or travel. You will benefit from our over forty years in the industry and will quickly see why your organization's material handling needs are best met through Granite Industrial Trucks.</p>
<p>Featuring a hydraulic jack that is manually operated from the handle, the manual pallet jack gets it name from the manual pump input to raise the fork. Thanks to their high capacity of up to three tons and excellent manoeuvrability in even the tightest of spaces, hand pallet trucks represent ideal warehouse aids. They may be a bit worn out, so when the lift is installed, the proposed 2 inch leaves may only have lifted the truck 1.5 inches.</p>
