<p>Studies have shown that there are roughly 900,000 Rough Terrain Forklifts used every day in U.S. businesses. Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers. The Industrial Truck Association (ITA, ) has defined seven classes of lift trucks, or forklifts, which are defined by the type of engine, work environment, operator position and equipment characteristics. In some cases, you may be looking to expand your business or take on work that requires equipment you don't have, like a forklift.</p>

<p>And Part B. Trucks should be recognized as being built in accord with paragraphs 7 through 143 of UL Standards for Safety 558, Second Edition, September 1961 Internal Combustion Engine-Powered Industrial Trucks” and paragraphs 7 through 130 and 132 through 187 of UL Standards for Safety 583, Fourth Edition, November 1956, Revised September 1960 Power-Operated Industrial Trucks.” Trucks and areas of use should be marked in accordance with NFPA Standard No. 505 — 1968, Section 800.</p>
<p>It is impractical to build a guard of sufficient strength to withstand the impact of a falling capacity load since such a guard would constitute a safety hazard because its structure would be so large that it might interfere with good visibility, and would weigh so much that it might make the truck top-heavy and unstable. These Class 5 forklifts, sometimes called Yard Trucks,” are larger when compared to a Cushion tire unit of equal capacity and offer a softer ride.</p>
<p>They have small tires designed to run on paved surfaces and are usually powered by an internal combustion engine running on gasoline, diesel, or propane fuel. Lift Capacity: 16000 lbs.
