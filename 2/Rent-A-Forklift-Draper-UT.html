Most trucks on the market today are built with what is commonly referred to as a body-on-frame design; the frame is built for the engine, drivetrain, and suspension, then a separate body is attached to the frame.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
