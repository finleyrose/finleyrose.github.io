<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely. Because rough terrain vertical mast forklifts are larger and made to handle heavier loads than vertical mast counterbalanced forklifts (classes 1, 4 and 5), they require more space to operate as well as a sturdy surface that offers substantial support. Call Andy Putnam, Rental Manager (315) 413-4150 or use the Rentals Request form to send us a Quick Request.</p>
<p>Also, aftermarket installations like a lift kit can void the warranty on a lot of vehicles - that's a lot of benefits to leave on the table. Establish a timeline of how long your rental will last. We are able to meet your long-term and short-term forklift requirements whether you are based within close proximity to a major city or in a small town. Pump trucks are primarily used as a pallet jack but do not use any electric power to lift any materials.</p>
<h2>What Kind of License Do I Need to Drive a Forklift in Topsham </h2>

Obviously the biggest difference between the two forklifts is the position of the operator. It's against the law for anyone to operate a counterbalance forklift or any type of powered industrial truck without OSHA-approved forklift training and certification.</p>

With a solid schedule of consistent and high-quality maintenance, your forklift can be relied upon to provide years of worry-free performance. Regardless of the order picker or forklift job, one thing is for certain: if your employees drive order picker trucks, they need an order picker license.</p>
<p>Do not lift the heaviest load to the maximum lift or stacking height. Here we are talking about ways to improve your business with the help of a hand pallet truck. Our quality and reputation for reliability make our forklifts ideal for rentals, short or long term.
