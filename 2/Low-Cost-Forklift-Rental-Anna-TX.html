Powered by a lithium-ion battery, this electric pallet truck offers up to 3 hours of use. Depending on the quality of your shocks, you'll likely enjoy more control of your vehicle and higher ground clearance as well. We will focus on how to maintain your forklift's stability and handling, as well as how to lift loads properly.</p>
<p>Forklift operators can lift up and lower the forks, use side shifters to move loads and tilt the mast so the load doesn't slide off the forks. The multidirectional BT Reflex F-series of reach trucks offer AC power, clear-view masts, 360° steering and sideways battery exchange for increased productivity and manoeuvrability. Aimed at a prosperous growth in this domain, we are engaged in offering an excellent quality range of Hydraulic Hand Pallet Truck.</p>
