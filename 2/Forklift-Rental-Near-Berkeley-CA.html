<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>Reach trucks have baselegs extending from the tractor to support the load. Some of the pallet trucks also independently reduce high speeds when cornering, adjust their drive behavior to the current situation, or help when climbing gradients. Rather than increasing the distance between the body and the frame, a suspension lift kit either replaces or adjusts the truck's leaf springs to lift its suspension.</p>

With a solid schedule of consistent and high-quality maintenance, your forklift can be relied upon to provide years of worry-free performance. Regardless of the order picker or forklift job, one thing is for certain: if your employees drive order picker trucks, they need an order picker license.</p>

Including heavy-duty shop presses, steel lever bars, pole jacks, reel jacks, screw jacks, and several types of ratchet jacks, we offer a full line of mechanical jacks capable of lifting up to 75 tons.
