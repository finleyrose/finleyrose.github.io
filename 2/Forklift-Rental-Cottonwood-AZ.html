A significant portion of my business deals with forklift operator training (or more precisely, powered industrial truck operator training).</p>
<p>The rough terrain forklift dates back to about 1946 when a two-pronged lift attachment was placed on a power buggy or tractor chassis. Meanwhile, two Chinese forklift giants integrate resources to be more competitive in key components. Where typical fork lift trucks need to approach a load head on, on a flat even surface, an all-terrain or rough terrain forklift can pick up a load even when the load is on a slope or otherwise unusually positioned.</p>

Counterbalanced = A lift truck that utilizes weight in its chassis to counterbalance a load against the center line of the drive wheels.

Moreover, an optical sensor mounted on the load section can automatically lower pallets to an ideal working height.</p>

We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs. Used in different warehouses and go-downs, the offered pallet truck is known for its excellent load carrying capacity. While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>
