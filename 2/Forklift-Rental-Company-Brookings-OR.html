These mobile, self-loading trucks are power-propelled to carry, push, pull, lift, stack or tier material.</p>

The arm allows the operator flexibility in picking up and placing loads (at various distances and lift heights) from the front of the machine. Load capacities are similar to a standard lift, ranging between 5,000 lbs and 36,000 lbs.</p>
