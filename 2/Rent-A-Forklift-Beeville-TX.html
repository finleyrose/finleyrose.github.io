<p>The standard lift kit raises your truck higher off the ground with affecting how it handles. Side Loader forklifts have been popular in the past as they were the first forklift designed specifically for long load handling. Unfortunately for those who want the Rocky Ridge bumpers on their Jeep but don't necessarily care about the rest of the lift kit, they are not available as a separate option.</p>

We are a well-known for manufacturing, exporting, wholesaling, distributing and supplying Hand Pallet Truck With Scale, which is an efficient product of our company.
