<p>Powerful performance meets compact design. Trucks with a body lift often have a visible gap between the frame and body, which a lot of people find unsightly. This is due to the fact that a used forklift really has no suspension and it is not possible to maintain tire to ground contact in uneven environments. These fees are based on the length of the time you have your rental. The hand pallet truck lift offers load shifting, lifting and lowering functions.</p>
<p>This Raymond-exclusive feature maximizes truck speed as the platform rises, capitalizing on an area of opportunity for providing faster travel between picks compared to conventional speed control. Ground clearance same as cushion tire forklift or Electric 4 wheel units. With the test load supported by the forks in a normal and unrestrained manner, elevate the load to the maximum height at which unrestrained, horizontal travel is permitted.</p>
