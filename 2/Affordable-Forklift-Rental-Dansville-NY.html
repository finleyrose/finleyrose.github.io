<p>Suspension lifts are also found on a number of high performance sports cars, in which a very low ground clearance is used to improve handling, using an aerodynamic effect known as downforce; examples include the Ferrari 488, Lamborghini Huracan, McLaren 720S, and the second generation Ford GT. Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>
<p>The following are examples of Class IV powered industrial trucks. Semi-experience operator training - A slightly rare form of training, this is useful for those who have learnt to drive forklifts elsewhere, such as in a garden or other private property, but don't have formal training.

<p>While excellent for indoor use, reach trucks for not suitable for outdoor work due to their under-carriage clearance. Many rough terrain forklifts can also handle work platforms. High sales of new construction lifts after 2008 are loading the used market up with competitively priced units today. Forklift operators must beaware of the necessary forklift safety practices for each classification and certified on each class of forklift to operate it.</p>
<p>With Crown's Stability Stance, operators have four points of solid contact with the lift truck when stopping and starting from 9 metres in the air. Like a rental car, if you were to need insurance coverage, then this could be another $50 to $150+ per day and would only cover the truck. This is because the forks are mounted to the side of the truck and can pick up wide or long loads that would be awkward or inaccessible with a straight forward forklift.</p>
