There are many attachments that can be purchased to go along with used rough terrain forklifts.</p>

Linde has developed special design features that simplify the process of picking for every height - from the layout of the control platform and control panels, to the fold-out cab railings. The BT Levio W-series of powered pallet trucks consists of six truck models, including the compact LWE130 for more light-duty applications.</p>
<p>Additionally, the larger tires of a lifted truck are designed to flex around obstacles like large rocks, which translates to more tire-to-ground contact for greater traction.
