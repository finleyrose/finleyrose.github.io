Layman's Terms: Off-roading is fun, until you have to be towed 30 miles to a shop when your driveshaft falls out because you just had to have the huge lift. If you lift a load too high, you can cause the forklift to tip over. As time has passed, forklifts have tended to specialization.</p>

It is at this point of rebound that big lifted trucks are likely to crash or flip, because it can be difficult to control the bouncing.
