<h3>How To Make The Right Choice To Buy Used Forklifts Pawleys Island SC 29585</h3>
<p>When you have a pallet jack at your warehouse to help employees tackle tasks that are physically challenging, you avoid this dissatisfaction, which can affect productivity. Reach trucks are used in large warehouses that store pallets several rows high on shelving or have deep shelves that can hold multiple pallets. The increased ground clearance reduces the risk of you damaging the underbelly of your vehicle.</p>
<p>The second type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit. The average pallet jack can lift about 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg).
