<p>We provide high quality counterbalance forklift, reach forklift truck, pallet truck, stacker dedicated to your business. The counterbalance forklift is a popular lift that features forks in the front and a weight in the back of the vehicle to counterbalance the weight of the load. Popular brands of standup forklifts include Yale, Crown, Baker, Hyster, and Raymond, which range in price from as little as $5,000 used to as much as $35,000 for a fully equipped new machine. Counterbalanced forklifts carry their loads in front of their support point.</p>
<p>Completing your training and receiving your certification will only enable you to drive that specific forklift truck — any additional trucks will require you to take an entirely new course. We have LPG, electric, diesel, and gasoline powered forklifts with lift capacity from 3,000 to 36,000 lb. We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

<p>Toyota forklifts stand out from the competition in one category. The term fork lift refers to a variety of motor-powered trucks equipped with lifting forks that are used for loading, unloading, and organizing materials that are stacked on pallets or designed for lifting with forks. This type of rough terrain forklift is vehicle-mounted and fitted with a telescopic boom lift, which allows this machine to pick up and transport loads at various distances and heights.</p>
<p>You will commonly see these lift trucks used at construction sites to transport and lift building materials. Lift and tow heavy or extremely large loads efficiently and safely in rough terrain environments with power and precision. Suitable for heavy-duty applications, our multidirectional reach truck is capable of handling both conventional pallets and long loads, such as steel beams and plastic pipes.</p>

<p>Because they do not require the purchase of fuel, a used electric forklift will be cheaper to use than an internal combustion engine forklift, even though they have an initial higher cost.

<p>Largely intended for safety during forward reach operation, they prevent rollovers by elevating the front tires off the ground and counterbalancing the extra weight.

At Durante Rentals, we rent forklifts and telehandlers for all your material handling needs.</p>
