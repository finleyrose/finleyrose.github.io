Lencrow Forklifts has a range of new electric-powered order pickers to suit each operator style and handling application. The truck should be equipped with the attachment and the test load (when required) should be representative of the capacity of the truck and attachment combination.</p>
<p>Using the procedure outlined for the test, a truck carrying the rated capacity load elevated to the maximum height at which unrestricted horizontal travel is permitted, should not overturn when the test platform upon which the truck is standing is tilted to a 6 percent slope. Loads are always to be carried low to the ground, and a forklift is never to be driven with empty forks higher than 5 or 6 inches off the ground.</p>
