<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet. Cherry Pickers are found in warehouse environments where they prepare orders for shipment using the cherry picker machine.</p>
<p>These are Sit-down forklifts designed for indoor use with solid, cushioned tires — powered by internal-combustion (IC) engines that run on diesel fuel or, more commonly, LP gas. You don't want a truck that was lifted by some random mechanic since there is no guarantee the mechanic knows what he or she is doing. Since they can easily move from indoor to exterior jobs, these machines are remarkably flexible.</p>

<p>Despite being used, all of our rough terrain forklifts are of a high standard. However, forklift trucks come in a number of different sizes and models. Obviously the biggest difference between the two forklifts is the position of the operator. It's against the law for anyone to operate a counterbalance forklift or any type of powered industrial truck without OSHA-approved forklift training and certification.</p>
<p>Before you decide to lift your truck, it's important to understand some of the pros and cons of driving a lifted vehicle. If your forklift is overloaded, it can cause it to tip to the side when you turn or when you are near a steep edge. Forklifts run on diesel, liquid propane and electric. If you have previously owned a forklift, determine what aspects you liked and didn't like about the lift.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we offer our customers the possibility of covering their machinery damage with STILL Rental Plus. This is the total amount of weight the forklift can move off the ground.

Overall Height Raised = The maximum extended height of the top of the load backrest or fork carriage of a completely extended mast.</p>
<p>Steering, braking, accelerating and all the nuances of driving will change once the shape of the truck has changed, so be prepared for an all-new ride after completing a suspension lift. With a wide range of models Hyster® reach forklift trucks and stackers feature powerful AC technology on traction, pump and steer motors to deliver superior performance and low cost of operation.</p>
<p>For the most part, trucks are made with body over frame” construction, which means that there is a basic metal frame for the truck and then the body of the truck is placed onto that frame and attached.
