H&E were founded in 1961 and have been providing equipment rental for more than 50 years.

<p>You must know how to safely load, unload, and drive a rough terrain forklift to prevent accidents and injuries. This is best if you have a large warehouse or need different types of lifts for the jobs you'll be doing.
