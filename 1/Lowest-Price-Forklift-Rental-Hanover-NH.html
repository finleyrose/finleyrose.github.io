Buyers can make the mistake of only opting for more recent models of used fork trucks, but far more important than this is the number of operating hours and the overall condition of the second hand truck for sale.</p>

<p>The most complex type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit, which allows your truck to be boosted higher than that of a body kit.
