Pump trucks are primarily used as a pallet jack but do not use any electric power to lift any materials.</p>

A reach truck provides a range of features to help you to do the job. Indoor forklifts come with cushion tires to make it easier to maneuver on smooth warehouse floors.</p>
<p>This alone should be reason enough to ensure your operators are properly trained where safety and health regulations are involved. New and used Reach Trucks are also available depending on the length of rental and budget. Suspension lift kits are best for drivers who are avid off-roaders because they give you additional ground clearance.
