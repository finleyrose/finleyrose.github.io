Although lifted trucks can make hitting the trail a lot easier, they do have some drawbacks that you want to keep in mind before committing to one.</p>
<p>Between a 45° forward tilt and a 15° rear tilt, the H Series forklift offers the most mast tilt in the industry, allowing operators to keep loads level on any terrain or slope. A lift kit gives your truck a lot of added benefits that other trucks don't have. Lifted trucks get instant attention on the streets, and if you're looking for off-road performance, the extra ground clearance in a lifted truck can mean the difference between an exciting run, and walking home.</p>
<h2>For Lift Truck Brighton</h2>
<p>Many of these Custom and Lifted trucks are featured in some of the highest trim levels and many come standard with I6, V6 or V8 engines, meaning you just might get a lot more powertrain, torque and convenient technological amenities for your money; such features include front dual-zone climate control, front and rear parking sensors, adjustable pedals, a built-in navigation system or a HomeLink Universal Garage Door Opener.</p>
