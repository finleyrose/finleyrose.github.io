<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>Jacks can also lessen fatigue of employees, as they won't be taking on the physical toll of moving heavy material. If you refuel the tanks twice a day (the average for full-time use), this equates to a yearly fuel cost of $1,500 for electric, $15,000 for diesel and about $12,500 for propane. Often considered to be in a class of their own are aerial lifts , which give a single operator the ability to boom himself up to a hard-to-reach area in a man basket.” This category includes a wide variety of personnel lifts, including boom lifts and scissor lifts.</p>
