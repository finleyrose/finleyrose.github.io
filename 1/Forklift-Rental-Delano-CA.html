Many locations have specialized car dealerships that work with modified vehicles such as lifted trucks. The reach truck typically works as part of a material-handling system where two requirements are equally important: cube utilization (ratio of occupied space to total cubic space available, usually expressed as a percentage) and selectivity (amount or percentage of product in a warehouse which is accessible to the aisle for picking).</p>
<p>Raymond pallet trucks execute versatile dock, horizontal and low-level order picking warehouse activities with five different available products—end rider, center rider, enclosed end rider, motorized walkie and tow tractor.
