<p>A truck that has had its suspension modified so that it rides way too far off the ground, usually to the point where the high center of gravity could actually be dangerous. Limited Free Lift = The amount the forks raise before the overall lowered height of a mast increases. ProControl Account Management by Herc Rentals comes with tools to make your job easier, faster and more rewarding. Narrow aisle forklifts like walkie stackers and side loaders can measure less than 5 ft. However, if you are using a forklift in a warehouse setting, it is important to consider the aisle width.</p>
<p>That's why our focus is making the forklift rental process quick and easy, without the usual red tape and fine print of the big rental companies. The 37-inch-wide C-G chassis—about five to six inches narrower than the chassis of a typical 4,000 to 7,000 lb. forklift—allows C-G Series forklifts to navigate tight rack storage aisles. Our stores in Sacramento, CA and throughout northern central California are fully equipped to meet your demands for rental forklifts.</p>

Rough terrain environments don't have to slow you down with Access Hire's range of all-terrain forklifts that offer greater maneuverability and keep the machine moving in the roughest of applications.</p>
<p>Omnidirectional technology (such as Mecanum wheels ) can allow a forklift truck to move forward, diagonally and laterally, or in any direction on a surface. This series offers models for rough-terrain applications as well. Originally a lock company, Hyster-Yale is now almost exclusively a forklift manufacturer. And with how much you can save with a high-quality pre-owned vehicle and still get behind the wheel of a safe, reliable, and ready for adventure car, truck or SUV.</p>
<p>Also, this rental service is available to us in many types at pocket-friendly rates. To operate an order-picking forklift truck you need an LO high risk work licence.
