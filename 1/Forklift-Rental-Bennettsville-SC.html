<p>Perhaps the inventory that needs to be moved will pay for the rentals, or money is just tight right now. Save time and money with the compact and manoeuvrable 25 industrial forklift.

<p>You can rely on Westminster Lift Truck Services. These forklifts can come with lifting heights of up to 20 feet.

<p>However, that doesn't mean that everyone should jump feet first into the decision to install a lift kit on their truck.
