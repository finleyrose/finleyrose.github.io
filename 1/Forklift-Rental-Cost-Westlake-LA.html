<h2>Pallet Lift Westlake</h2>

Many of the hazards posed by forklifts can be mitigated with custom signage and clear visual communication.</p>
<p>Each type of powered industrial truck presents different operating hazards. According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns. For those who do a lot of off-roading, a taller stance adds extra ground clearance, and allows for bigger wheels and tires.</p>

Trying to lift loads too heavy for your forklift creates a great risk of a tip-over accident, this can also risk damaging product and plant facilities. A double mast forklift has a second mast attached to the carriage of the first mast. There's no better way to move equipment and materials around a factory or work site than with a forklift.</p>
<p>We back most used forklifts with a 1 year parts and labour warranty. With excellent machine and load stability due to an optimum centre of gravity and suspension provided by large diameter tyres, these machines provide high mobility and great productivity in rough terrain environments. It is rumored that electric forklifts are maintenance free due to less moving parts and their cleaner environments.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>
