Those are the vehicles that you will need to test drive before making a decision.

<p>Average forklifts for everyday usage start at a lift height of eight feet and go all the way up to 20 feet, but there are units that reach far above those levels. 55. 55 Rule: Employees will not place any part of their bodies outside the running lines of an industrial truck or between mast uprights or other parts of the truck where shear or crushing hazards exist.</p>
<p>The latter allows forklift designers more freedom in ergonomic design.

Order picker trucks are types of lift trucks that are controlled from a carriage wherein the operator stance can be found. They offer complete repair and maintenance services across most equipment makes and models. Some people will lift their trucks just for show, and that's cool if you do, we don't judge you.</p>

Order-pickers and drivers of powered high-lift trucks face a variety of hazards that require training on compliant standards and practices, truck operational procedures, working surfaces and conditions, as well as fall protection training.</p>
