<h2>Maintenance Of Forklift Brakes Prevents Smashups Brewster </h2>
<p>In an Order Picking Forklift the Operator goes up into the air with the load and either places pallets mechanically, or moves smaller loads on and off the order picker manually. Well, you're going to have to work a little bit harder than a 6” suspension lift to pimp your truck out, but it's still doable. Theoretically this is to increase off-road performance, although the higher center of gravity would likely make them more likely to roll over on rough terrain.</p>

The larger tires allowed by lifted trucks is one of the biggest advantages for going off-road with this type of vehicle.</p>
