<p>A forklift that raises your intralogistics to a new level. But as a general rule, most forklifts can take a multitude of different sizes and configurations. Rarely will you find a lifted truck that still has the stock tires on it. Larger off road tires are not designed to maximize road performance.

The Yale electric order pickers offer quiet, effortless operation and an abundance of features, all focused on ensuring operators can achieve faster, more accurate, order picking no matter the order picker.</p>

In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
