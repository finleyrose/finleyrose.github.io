<p>Known for their durability and superior design, we are pleased to feature cushion and pneumatic tire trucks, and electric trucks in both 3-and 4-wheel designs. Reach trucks come in multiple forms, including the Stand-Up truck and Double-Deep truck. We teach forklift operators. Lift Code 4: Turret Trucks. Providing a standup platform rather than a seat allows for the reach truck's shortened length giving it its "tight access" capability. We offer lifted trucks across a variety of models and trim levels, so no matter if you're shopping for a baseline full-size pickup or an upgraded heavy duty model, you can secure whichever you need with a lifted upgrade.</p>

The electric pallet jack is motorised and thus provides for faster operation. With the test load elevated to maximum height, without change in the original 19 load overhang dimensions, the test platform should be titled to a minimum of 4 percent, without overturning the truck.</p>
