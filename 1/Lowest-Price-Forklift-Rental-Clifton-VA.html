<p>This removes the need for the operator to manually adjust the tines for different sized loads. Electric forklifts are quiet as well, making them ideal for warehouse and other indoor use. Be mindful of pedestrians, other industrial lift trucks, vehicles, materials, etc. Whether you need a forklift for one day or five years, Crown has a rental solution for you.

Most standard forklifts can reach heights between 10 and 15 ft, but special forklifts like the telehandler can lift as high as 55 ft depending on the telehandler size you select.</p>
